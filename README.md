**Practical techniques to secure old vulnerabilities against modern attacks**

## What is this book about?
SQL injection (SQLi) is probably the most infamous attack that can be unleashed against applications on the internet. SQL Injection Strategies is an end-to-end guide for beginners looking to learn how to perform SQL injection and test the security of web applications, websites, or databases, using both manual and automated techniques. The book serves as both a theoretical and practical guide to take you through the important aspects of SQL injection, both from an attack and a defense perspective.
You’ll start with a thorough introduction to SQL injection and its impact on websites and systems. Later, the book features steps to configure a virtual environment, so you can try SQL injection techniques safely on your own computer. These tests can be performed not only on web applications but also on web services and mobile applications that can be used for managing IoT environments. Tools such as sqlmap and others are then covered, helping you understand how to use them effectively to perform SQL injection attacks

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Focus on how to defend against SQL injection attacks
* Understand web application security
* Get up and running with a variety of SQL injection concepts
* Become well-versed with different SQL injection scenarios
* Discover SQL injection manual attack techniques
